Assignment 1

Second Milestone

In the third milestone I learned further manipulation including reordering, renaming and deleting with a standard swipe gesture. In addition to that, there are several new concepts that improve app usability like JSON persistence, loading indicators and a home screen app icon. I have also learned how to write additional tests for the modified structs and JSON functions.

I have implemented these concepts to create a Checklist list displays a loading indicator and home icon. From that screen you can add, delete with a swipe gesture, rename before going on to the items in each individual checklist. The items can be manipulated in the same way as the checklists in addition to to checkedStatus functions and also has a loading indicator.
